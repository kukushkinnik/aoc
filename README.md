# Advent of Code

Personal repository of Advent of Code solutions.

[Advent of Code](https://www.genome.gov/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after solving the first).

This solutions is not most efficient and needs refactoring. This is just my first attempt ever in AOC.
